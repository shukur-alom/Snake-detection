# Snake-detection

This is a web application built using Streamlit that takes an input image and predicts the type of snake it is. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for snake classification. The app is powered by the following libraries:

- Streamlit (v1.27.1)
- Streamlit Lottie (v0.0.5)
- OpenCV Python (v4.7.0.68)
- TensorFlow (v2.11.1)
- Matplotlib (v3.7.2)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/shukur-alom/Snake-detection.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

The snake identification model used in this app is a Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN). It has been trained on a dataset of snake images to classify different snake 
species. The model's architecture and weights are included in the model/ directory.
